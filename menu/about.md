I work with [Dr. Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) on *transfer learning* and *urban computing*. Prior to UW, I pursued two B.S. degrees in [Applied Statistics](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) and [Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/Economics/) at Purdue University. I earned my M.S. degree in [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University.
