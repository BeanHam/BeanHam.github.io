I am currently a second year PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/) at University of Washington, Seattle. I work with [Dr. Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) on applications of machine learning in urban computing. 

Prior to UW, I pursued two B.S. degrees in [Applied Statistics](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) and [Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/Economics/) at Purdue University. I earned my M.S. degree in [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University. During my master's study, I worked with [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/) on the criminal recidivism prediction using interpretable machine learning models. Additionally, I worked with [Dr. Michael Lutz](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/michael.lutz) on cognitive impairment analysis among elder people.
