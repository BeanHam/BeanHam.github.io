I am currently a third year PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/) at University of Washington, Seattle. I am supervised by [Dr. Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) on **Tranfer Learning** and **Urban Computing**. Prior to UW, I pursued two B.S. degrees in Applied Statistics and Economics at Purdue University. I earned my M.S. degree in Statistical Science at Duke University, where I was supervised by [Dr. Cynthis Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/home.html) on interpretable machine learning in recidivism prediction. I also worked with [Dr. Michael William Lutz](https://neurology.duke.edu/profile/michael-william-lutz) on bioinformatics project.
