I am currently a second year PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/) at University of Washington, Seattle. I work with [Dr. Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) on applications of machine learning in urban computing. During my master's study, I did research in interpretable machine learning for criminal recidivism prediction with [Dr. Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/) in the Prediction Analysis Lab at Duke University. I also worked with [Dr. Michael Lutz](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/michael.lutz) on cognitive impairment analysis among elder people.
