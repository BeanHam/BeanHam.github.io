I am currently a first year PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/) at University of Washington, with working [Professor Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/). Previously, I did research in interpretable machine learning for criminal recidivism prediction with [Dr. Cynthia Rudin] (https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/) in the Prediction Analysis Lab at Duke University.
