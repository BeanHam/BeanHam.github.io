I am currently a first year PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://stat.duke.edu) at University of Washington. 

Prior to coming to Duke, I worked with Aviad Tsherniak on the [Cancer Data Science](http://www.cancerdatascience.org) team at the Broad Institue of MIT and Harvard. I contributed to the [Cancer Dependency Map](https://depmap.org/portal/) effort with a focus on data analysis for the [PRISM](https://depmap.org/portal/prism/) profiling method. Before that, I was an undergraduate at Stanford, where I studied mathematics, creative writing and jazz performance.

In my spare time I enjoy reading Russian novels and short stories. I also like to play jazz drums. Some day, I hope to become a bassist and trumpet player as well.
