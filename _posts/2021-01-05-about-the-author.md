I am currently a first year PhD student in the [Department of Information Science](https://ischool.uw.edu/) at University of Washington, Seattle. I'm working with [Professor Bill Howe](https://faculty.washington.edu/billhowe/) and [Professor Chirag Shah](https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/profile/chirags).

Prior to coming to UW, I pursued two B.S. degrees in [Applied Statistics](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/) and [Economics](https://krannert.purdue.edu/academics/Economics/) at Purdue University. I earned my M.S. degree in [Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at Duke University. During my Master's study, I worked with [Professor Cynthia Rudin](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/) on the criminal recidivism prediction project and I worked with [Dr. Michael Lutz](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/michael.lutz) on cognitive impairment among elder people project. 

I enjoy music, working out, boxing, and snow skiing!
